    <h1>Exercise 1: Scatterplot</h1>

    <h2>Drawing a Scatterplot with HTML Canvas</h2>
    <div>
        <p>However, a table does not suffice to visualize attributes of all data items at once. Instead we can use
            techniques to visually encode a subset of attributes. A scatterplot is such a visualization technique that
            encodes two quantitative attributes as the position of a circle.</p>

        <p>The code snippet below creates an HTML canvas and iterates over all items from the movies dataset to draw a
            circle. See <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API">here</a>
            for a documentation and further reading on the HTML canvas. Right now, the functions for mapping data values
            to a position on the canvas are not implemented. As a consequence, most of the circles are drawn outside of
            the canvas area.</p>

        <h3>Tasks</h3>
        <p>Complete the following tasks using only the given code and HTML canvas. Although <em>d3</em> is available, do
            <b>not</b> use it for these tasks.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Draw the circles at the correct positions. Use the width and height of the canvas and the data domains
                <code>domainX</code> and <code>domainY</code>. Add a margin such that all circles are fully visible.
            </li>
            <li>Since the dataset is relatively large, there is a lot of <em>overdraw</em> in the plot. Think of a way
                to mitigate this issue by changing the appearance of the circles but without changing the positions.
            </li>
            <li>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_chart">bubbleplot</a> is a scatterplot
                that encodes another attribute in the size of the circles. Encode the attribute <em>rating</em> using
                the size
                of your circles. Think carefully about what size means here!</li>
            <li>The dataset contains a lot of English movies but fewer movies in other languages. Encode the language
                using the color of the circles to distinguish English movies from those in other languages.</li>
        </ol>

    <h2>Drawing a Scatterplot with d3</h2>
    <p>Your scatterplot already shows the distribution of the data values with respect to the data domain. However,
        without any labels it is very hard to actually derive individual values from it. <a
            href="https://d3js.org/">d3</a> is a JavaScript library &quot;for manipulating documents based on
        data&quot;. It provides a lot of functionality for creating interactive visualizations for the web.</p>
    <p>Have a look at the <a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/learn-d3">d3 introduction</a> to understand its
        principles. Most importantly, d3 does not really create visualizations by itself but allows you to bind data to
        elements in the DOM and set their attributes based on that data. While d3 can also use the canvas, it is mainly
        used together with <em>Scalable Vector Graphics</em> (SVG). Make sure to have a basic understanding of how SVG
        works (e.g. by reading <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG">this documentation</a>).</p>
    <p>In our example the data is the array of movies. Every individual movie is tied to a circle and we want to set its
        2d position based on the corresponding attribute values. d3 provides scales that help with the mapping from data
        values to visual attributes. What you did by hand for your canvas-based scatterplot can be achieved more easily
        by using these scales. The code below sets up one scale for each axis that map from the data domain to a
        position in the plot.</p>
    <h3>Task</h3>
    <p>The given scales are already used to create an axis per attribute. Use d3 to add the circles representing each
        movie in the dataset with SVG. Make sure not to blindly copy code from somewhere else but to understand what is
        actually happening. Feel free to play around with the visual appearance of your scatter points by setting SVG
        attributes.</p>
